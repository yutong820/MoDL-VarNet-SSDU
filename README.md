## Configuration file

The configuration files are in `config` folder. Every setting is the same as the paper.

Configuration files for K=1 and K=10 are provided. The authors trained the K=1 model first, and then trained the K=10 models using the weights of K=1 model.

## Train

You can change the configuration file for training by modifying the `train.sh` file.

```
scripts/train.sh
```

## Test

You can change the configuration file for testing by modifying the `test.sh` file.

```
scripts/test.sh
```

## Saved models

Saved models are provided.

K=1: `workspace/base_modl,k=1/checkpoints/final.epoch0049-score37.3514.pth` 

K=10: `workspace/base_modl,k=10/checkpoints/final.epoch0049-score39.6311.pth`
